Dashboard directions for instructors


Key things to remember:
	Regarding quiz-pages in the same folder, each must have a different quizpageNumber defined in the script tag of the html file.
	The _code folder must be exactly 2 levels above all quiz pages.
	When testing your pages in a browser, you must be connected to the internet.  In order for the logging to work, all files must be uploaded to a server and accessed there.
	If you want to change a style for all quizzes, edit the css file in the _code folder.  If you want the change to apply only to one quiz, edit the html file for that quiz.
