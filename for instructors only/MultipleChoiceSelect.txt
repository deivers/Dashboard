About the Multiple Choice and Multiple Select template
Version 1.0  November 2013
Created by One Time Software (www.onetimesoftware.com)

The Multiple Choice/Select template was created with Adobe Edge Animate.  The template has the following features and limitations:
	-  
	-  Students cannot from a standard browser inspect the html in order to see the answers.  See the file "aboutCheating.txt" for more info.
	-  Setting up the quiz with your own content is easy, but you should be comfortable with editing html using a plain text editor.
	-  When authoring the content of a quiz, you arrange the quiz in correct answer order and when loaded in a browser the javascript shuffles either the questions or the answers.  Specify which you want shuffled using the parameter shuffleWhich in the html file, setting it to either "draggables" to shuffle the answers or "questions" to shuffle the non-draggable items.
	-  You can specify whether incorrect answers are immediately rejected versus forcing the student to complete the quiz before giving any feedback.  See the rejectWrongAnswers and requireCompletion parameters.
	-  The number of draggable items can be equal to the number of questions, or the draggables can have one or more extra items to make the quiz more challenging.
	-  Optionally, you can adjust the styling (color, font, widths, etc.) in the style tag near the top of the html file.
	-  You can use images instead of text for the questions and/or answers.
	-  You can even use audio - contact One Time Software if you need assistance.
	-  You can log student answers and see a summary using the Dashboard.  See the instructions for the Dashboard for details.

Folder structure
	-  The files in a particular folder need to stay together:
		MatchupStacked.html    ok to rename
		LogResponse.php    don't rename
		Dashboard.html    don't rename, but can be removed if you won't be using this feature
	-  Folders can be renamed and moved as long as they remain 2 levels deeper than the _code folder and share the same parent folder
	-  The recommended folder structure is:
		_code folder
		Module1 folder
			Topic1 folder
				html files
				quiz folder
			Topic2 folder
				html files
				quiz folder
		Module2 folder
			etc.
	-  The Matchup quiz is really just a single web page.  What you normally think of as a quiz at the end of a biology topic could contain, for example, a matchup page plus a multiple choice page plus a short answer page, etc.  The "quiz folder" above will contain whatever quiz pages you've decided to use.  For example:
		quiz folder
			MatchupDNA.html
			ShortAnswerInheritance.html
			SequencerCellDivision.html
			LogResponse.php
			Dashboard.html


Steps to author your own quiz pages:
	1.	
	2.	Optionally, set the following parameters in the ............ as you see fit:
			questionNumber
			questionSummaryText = "DNA structures";
			shuffleWhich
			rejectWrongAnswers
			requireCompletion
			logResponsesToDashboard
			nextPageUrl
		See the inline comments after each variable for more information.
	4.	Each checkbox must have a corresponding feedbackBox, though you may delete the text in the box if you don't want to provide feedback to the student.
	5. 	Save the project and test it by pressing cmd-return
