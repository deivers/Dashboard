About the Matchup Quiz template
Version 1.2  November 2013
Created by One Time Software (www.onetimesoftware.com)

One Time Software created more than one Matchup Quiz template.  These instructions are for the Matchup Quiz that was NOT created with Adobe Edge Animate.  The template has the following features and limitations:
	-  Students cannot from their browser peek at the html source in order to see the answers.  If you need even stronger security, contact One Time Software for assistance.
	-  Setting up the quiz with your own content is easy, but you should be comfortable with editing html using a plain text editor.
	-  You arrange the quiz in "correctly answered order" and the javascript shuffles either the questions or the answers when the page is loaded.  Specify which you want shuffled using the parameter shuffleWhich, setting it to either "draggables" to shuffle the answers or "dropZones" to shuffle to "questions".
	-  You can specify whether incorrect answers are immediately rejected versus forcing the student to complete the quiz before giving any feedback.  See the rejectWrongAnswers and requireCompletion parameters.
	-  The number of draggable items can be equal to the number of dropZones, or the draggables can have one or more extra items to make the quiz more challenging.
	-  Optionally, you can adjust the styling (color, font, widths, etc.) in the html style tag.
	-  You can use images instead of text for the questions and/or answers.
	-  You can even use audio - contact One Time Software for details.
	-  You can log student answers and see a summary using the Dashboard.  See the instructions for the Dashboard for details.

Steps to insert your own content:
	1.	Locate the MatchupTemplate.html file and rename it according to the topic you will quiz on.  Edit the .html file, overwriting the existing text and add/remove div's as needed to match your number of items.
	2.	Optionally, set the following parameters in the html script as you see fit:
			shuffleWhich
			rejectWrongAnswers
			requireCompletion
		See the inline comments after each variable for more information.
	4.	Optionally, modify the html above and below the <div id="quiz"> tag to add title, instructions, links, etc.
	5. 	Save the html file and test it in a browser.  You need to be connected to the internet to test because the code loads javascript libraries when it runs.
	6.	To log student responses to the Dashboard, copy one of the LogResponse.php files to the same folder as your edited html file.

The following folder/files need to be in the _code folder 2 levels above the html file:
	common.css
	jquery.ui.touch-punch.min.js
	matchup3.js
	MatchupStacked.css  or  MatchupLateral.css

As noted before, do not change the name of .css or .js files.

To use images in the left column instead of text, replace:
			<div class="upperTab">
				<p class="tabText">
					One
				</p>
			</div>
with something like:
			<div>
				<img src="img/one.jpg">
			</div>
Of course, the corresponding image files must be in a sub-folder named "img" in this example.  Control the size of the images with 'width' in the style section.  The layout of the quiz works best if the images are all the same size, and they will be scaled to the value of 'width'.
