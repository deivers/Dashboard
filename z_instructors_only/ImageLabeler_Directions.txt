Image Labeler Directions for Instructors
Initial draft

Open the project (the .an file) with Edge Animate.
Replace the image with your own.
Edit/arrange text labels for your image as they should appear when the student has answered correctly.  To create a new label, tap the "T" in the tool bar, which is top left in the Edge window.
Adjust the width of all labels to be the same and wide enough for the popup menus that will be inserted when the page loads in a browser.
If you want "decoy" choices, create a label for each and place off stage to the left.
All labels and decoys must be assigned the CSS class "textSource"; all other labels should have no class (or some other class) assigned.  To assign a class or remove a class, select a text label and then tap on the "C" button at the top of the left panel.
Hit command-return to test in a browser.
Press option-command-S to publish (see File menu > "Publish settings..." to choose the folder to publish to).
