When deployed on your website, the recommended folder structure is:\
		_code folder\
		Module1 folder\
			Topic1 folder\
				html files\
				quiz folder\
					quizpage1.html\
					quizpage2.html\
					LogResponse.php\
					etc.\
			Topic2 folder\
				html files\
				quiz folder\
					etc.\
		Module2 folder\
			etc.\

Key things to remember:\
	Regarding quiz-pages in the same folder, each must have a different quizpageNumber defined in the script tag of the html file or in the compositionReady code of the Edge Animate project.\
	The _code folder must be exactly 2 levels above all quiz pages.\
	When testing your pages in a browser, you must be connected to the internet.  In order for the logging to work, all files must be uploaded to a server and accessed there.\
	If you want to change a style for all quizzes, edit the css file in the _code folder.  If you want the change to apply only to one quiz, edit the <style> section of the html file for that quiz.\
